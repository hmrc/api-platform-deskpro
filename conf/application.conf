# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,

# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# !!!WARNING!!! DO NOT CHANGE THIS ROUTER

# ~~~~~
# By default all controllers will have authorisation, logging and
# auditing (transaction monitoring) enabled.
